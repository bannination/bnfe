BanniNation.com Front End - the user interface layer to go along
with bannination.com v3.

## Getting started

You'll need nodejs (http://nodejs.org/) to run the local server, and npm to
install any dependencies. You can install from a package manager or build
from source.

Once node and npm are ready, from the root directory, run:

```sh
npm install
node simple_node_server.js
```

Open a browser tab to http://localhost:8000 and explore.
