with bannination.com v3.

## Getting started

You'll need nodejs (http://nodejs.org/) to run the local server, and npm to
install any dependencies. You can install from a package manager or build
from source.

Once node and npm and ready, from the root directory run:

```sh
npm install
node simple_node_server.js
```

Then open a browser tab to http://localhost:8000 and check out the site.
